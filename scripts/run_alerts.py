"""The desk's PAGER -- push critical alerts to the principal's phone via ntfy.sh (free, keyless).

Silent failure is the one failure mode a self-healing system can't fix: if the kill switch fires,
the heartbeat dies, or a conservatism defect sits unresolved while nobody is looking, the dashboard
knows and the principal doesn't. This closes that gap. Runs each watchdog tick (cheap, feed-only);
only CRITICAL conditions page, each deduped to once per 6h so it never becomes noise (a pager that
cries wolf is worse than none).

Subscribe once: install the ntfy app (or open the URL in any browser) and subscribe to the topic
printed on first run (stored in data/secrets/ntfy.json -- random suffix, treat like a password;
messages carry NO account data, only alert names).
