"""PORTFOLIO RISK REVIEW -- wire libs/stage14_5, self-arming at the sleeve count that makes it real.

THE GAP. libs/stage14_5 (10 modules: correlation shock, concentration, factor exposure, regime
exposure, crisis alpha, hedging) had no path from any entry point. These are the controls that
decide whether "orthogonal sleeves" is a true statement or a comfortable one.

WHY IT MATTERS EXACTLY HERE. The growth ladder's step 3 -- the 80-120%/yr band -- gates on
">= 3 orthogonal validated sleeves; LIVE portfolio Sharpe >= 1.2 over >= 60 live days", and its
own arithmetic says growth comes "by STACKING VALIDATED SLEEVES (sqrt-N Sharpe growth), never by
levering one unproven sleeve harder". That sqrt-N is a LIE under correlation convergence:
sleeves that look uncorrelated in calm markets converge toward 1.0 in stress, and the effective
bet count collapses exactly when drawdown arrives. A desk that stacks sleeves without measuring
shocked correlation is levering a diversification it does not have.

SELF-ARMING, NOT DEFERRED. Correlation shock is meaningless at one sleeve (a 1x1 correlation
matrix has no off-diagonal) and load-bearing at three. So the gate is a DATA CONDITION read from
the shadow registry, not a human decision someone has to remember: below MIN_SLEEVES it reports
DORMANT and explains what would arm it; at or above, it runs every control and fails loud. No
one has to notice the third sleeve landing -- the check notices.

Reports only. Zero promotion authority; no rail is touched. `--self-test` proves the engines run.
