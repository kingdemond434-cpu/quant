"""Cash-and-carry EXECUTOR -- the delta-neutral funding-harvest book, executed on the testnets.

Long spot (spot testnet) + short perp (futures testnet) on the top POSITIVE-funding perps that trade
on BOTH venues. Persistent loop with a BANDED rebalance (carry compounds -> hold, don't churn): it
only opens new carries and closes names that leave the positive-funding set, so turnover (and fees)
stay minimal. Tracks a real position state + marks the book, writes a heartbeat + kill-switch. This
is now the PROFIT-LEAD book; the perp L/S book drops to shadow. PAPER (testnet) -- it builds the
forward track record the edge-gate sizes leverage on. dry-run DEFAULT; --live to send paper orders.

# --- BNB FEE DISCOUNT (principal 2026-07-23; Gate-0 lever) -----------------------------------
# Live VIP0 fees (~20-25 bps round-trip) are the single biggest live drag on a book that turns
# over; BNB burn takes ~25% off. Maker-first is already implemented (_MAKER) -- this is the
# other, RISKLESS half, wired now so it is already ON at Gate 0 rather than a day-1 scramble.
# Best-effort + idempotent: a venue that lacks or rejects the endpoint changes nothing.
