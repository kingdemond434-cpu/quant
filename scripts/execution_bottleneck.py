"""EXECUTION BOTTLENECK -- apply the BOTTLENECK FIRST + REALITY FEEDBACK principles to live money.

THE DIRECTIVE SAYS THE MARKET IS THE FINAL JUDGE, so this reads the live book and the live trade
log rather than any research artifact. It answers three questions the desk cannot currently answer,
in descending order of how much money they are worth:

 Q1 WOULD THE CURRENT BOOK PASS THE CURRENT ENTRY GATE?
    The P0 fix (_DEFAULT_RT_BPS 4.5 -> 39.5) raised the bar ~8.8x this morning. Every open
    position was opened under the OLD bar. If the book fails the new gate, the desk is holding
    positions its own risk logic would now refuse to open -- and that is a decision, not a metric.

 Q2 HOW OFTEN DOES THE MAKER PATH FAIL?
    The trade log records spot_mode/fut_mode per leg. 'taker_fallback' means the patient-maker
    order did not fill and the executor crossed the spread. Every fallback converts a rebate into
    a spread payment. This is the single largest controllable cost on a delta-neutral carry and
    NOTHING on this desk currently counts it.

 Q3 WHAT IS ACTUALLY MEASURABLE, AND WHAT IS NOT?
    The 7.75x cost/funding figure is IMPLIED from a NAV residual. It has never been ATTRIBUTED to
    a leg, a symbol, or an execution mode. Under the measurement doctrine adopted today, an
    implied aggregate is not a measurement -- you cannot act on it because it does not say what
    to change. This script reports precisely which fields are missing to close that gap.
