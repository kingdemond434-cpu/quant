"""L1.67 -- NO SIZING PATH PRICES A STOP FROM ANOTHER INSTRUMENT'S CONSTANTS.

WHAT THIS CATCHES THAT NOTHING ELSE COULD

Every existing fence on this desk asks whether a number was FRESH (L1.44), whether its inputs
were PRESENT (L1.55), whether a denominator was REAL (L1.57/L1.60), whether two boards AGREE
(L1.61) or whether a gate ever RAN (L1.49). None of them can ask whether a number is in the
UNITS it claims. A stop distance multiplied by the wrong instrument's contract size produces a
lot that is well-formed, fresh, internally consistent, agreed on by every board that reads it,
and wrong by three orders of magnitude -- and the position it sizes is real.

`gateway.auto_lot`, `realised_q` and `promoted_lot` priced every sleeve as
`dist * CONTRACT_OZ * FX_EUR` -- gold's 100-ounce contract times a frozen EUR/USD rate, 92.00 --
whatever symbol the sleeve named. Measured against the venue's own tick values: EUR 0.86 per
price unit per lot on BTCUSD, 86.41 on XAUUSD, 542.40 on every JPY cross, 86,414 on EURUSD. One
constant, five orders of magnitude, wrong by 107x in one direction and 939x in the other.

IT WAS LIVE, NOT LATENT. `sleeve_set` rewrites every promoted sleeve's lot to "auto_ramp", so
the literal 0.01 the promoter writes never reaches the venue and `promoted_lot -> auto_lot` is
always taken. Measured at EUR 1,683.89 on 2026-08-20: a promoted CADJPY sleeve on a 0.50 stop
sized to 0.46 lot, logged EUR 21.16 at risk (1.26%, on policy) and actually risked EUR 124.75 --
7.41% of equity -- while `cap_by_heat` billed it gold's 0.98% and admitted three such sleeves
for a believed 2.94% book against a true 22.2%.

WHAT IT CHECKS

  1. UNIT DIVERGENCE. For every symbol in the universe, the true EUR-per-price-unit against the
     legacy constant. This is a MEASUREMENT and it is published whatever it says.
  2. NO CONSTANT ON THE SIZING PATH. The executable statements of every sizing function are
     AST-walked for the legacy constants. A docstring may quote them -- that is the record of
     what went wrong -- but a `Name` node in a live statement is the defect returning.
  3. EVERY SIZING CALL SITE PASSES A SYMBOL. A call with too few arguments takes the default,
     which is gold, which is the bug one argument later.
  4. THE SNAPSHOT'S AGE. `tick_value` carries an FX rate, so a stale universe is a stale
     conversion -- the same failure as the constant, just slower.

STATUS VALUES: OK / CONSTANT-ON-SIZING-PATH / SYMBOL-OMITTED / SNAPSHOT-STALE / UNMEASURED.
UNMEASURED when no symbol could be priced at all -- zero comparisons is never OK (L1.28a), and
a fence that scans an empty set and reports health is the L1.57 defect this desk has already
paid for once.

ANTI-TIMIDITY READING: a MEASUREMENT duty and a units check. It lifts nothing, sizes nothing,
promotes nothing, opens no gate and loosens no bar. It has no vocabulary for changing any value
it reads. Its whole effect is to make "this lot was priced in the account's currency"
distinguishable from "this lot was priced in gold's" -- byte-identical on this desk until now,
and only one of them is a position size.
