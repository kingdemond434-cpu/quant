"""DEAD-MAN'S SWITCH -- dumb, isolated, deterministic last-resort ruin rail.

TIER-3 NEVER-TOUCH (SKILL rail-autonomy tiers): this file may not be modified, disabled or
removed autonomously by the CRO/daily cycle -- explicit principal sign-off only.

Design (2026-07-12 external adversarial review, all five reviewers): the main executor's
risk controls are deterministic code, but they live in the SAME process/codebase the AI
edits daily. This process is the independent backstop: no LLM, no strategy logic, no JSON
config reads, no imports from libs/. It polls COMBINED book equity (futures margin balance
+ spot wallet value -- the book is delta-neutral, futures-only would false-fire on rallies)
once a minute, and if FIVE CONSECUTIVE valid readings sit below 65% of the high-water mark
(the 35% ruin-flatten level) it: writes the executor kill file, market-flattens every
futures position (reduce-only), sells spot balances to USDT, and pages the principal. It
keeps retrying while positions remain. Consecutive-reading confirmation means a transient
API glitch or a single bad mark cannot false-fire it.
