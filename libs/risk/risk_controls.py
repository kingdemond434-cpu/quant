"""Growth-POSITIVE risk controls -- limits sized at the ruin boundary, never from fear.

Design axiom: geometric growth is g ~= mu - sigma^2/2, so cutting the LEFT TAIL cuts sigma^2 faster
than mu -> it RAISES compounding. Every control here is derived from the ruin / max-DD math
(growth_leverage + the dynamic-leverage ruin cap), NOT from arbitrary caution. A limit that
binds tighter than the ruin boundary would be false conservatism (a bug that lowers log-wealth); a
limit AT the boundary only ever fires when NOT firing would risk ruin -- which destroys all future
compounding. So in normal operation these controls do nothing, and in a tail event they preserve the
ability to keep compounding.

Six controls, in increasing severity:
  * exposure guard  -- gross notional may not exceed the ruin-boundary leverage x equity (a backstop
                       against a sizing bug; never binds while we deploy below the ruin cap).
  * VENUE CAP       -- no single exchange may hold more than `venue_cap` of equity (gap #54).
  * FEE-VS-HARVEST  -- rolling-window fees above a documented fraction of the funding harvest PAUSE
                       new opens (gap #98). An open is always optional; a fee bill this size makes
                       it an optional loss.
  * BURN FLOOR      -- windowed net burn (fees minus harvest, venue income truth) at the DD-pause
                       fraction of equity PAUSES new opens even when marks hide the loss (gap #98).
  * DD circuit break -- above a stress drawdown, PAUSE new opens (keep existing carries earning
                       funding; never realises a loss). Kelly-consistent: uncertainty up -> less.
  * ruin kill-switch -- only a catastrophic equity loss (>= drawdown_ruin) forces a full flatten.
                       For a delta-neutral book this means an exchange/basis catastrophe -> survive.

GAP #54 -- COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATION, THE ONE FATAL RISK NOTHING CAPPED. Per-name was capped at
35% and per-factor was capped, while the fraction of net worth sitting inside a single exchange
was capped by nothing at all: `grep -rn 'per_venue|venue_cap|venue_exposure'` returned zero hits
across the whole repo. SYSTEM_REVIEW ranks this fatal in its own words -- *"an FTX-class failure
is fatal to deployed capital regardless of strategy correctness"*. Every other control here
assumes the exchange gives the money back.

It belongs in THIS file rather than the executor because it is the same kind of object as the
others: a pure ruin-boundary limit, not an execution detail. And it lands BEFORE live keys
deliberately -- with one venue the cap binds at 100% and changes nothing today, which is exactly
why installing it now is free and retrofitting it the day a second venue exists is not.

GAP #98 / LEDGER R0025 -- NO COST-RATE BRAKE EXISTED BETWEEN AN ALARM AND THE RUIN RAIL. The
2026-07-28 close-retry churn engine burned $1,456 of fees in 48h against $113 of LIFETIME funding
harvest. §40 (`check_fee_carry_ratio`, scripts/max_audit.py) fired ~27h before diagnosis and had
no authority to stop anything; the only mechanism that halted the fire was the equity ruin rail at
-35% -- after the money was gone. 94.1% of dead-man fire #6 was that software defect. The fix is
the two PAUSE-OPENS-ONLY triggers above: fail-closed on opens (an open is always optional), and
NEVER on closes -- a close is a certainty problem, not a fee problem (L1.45, incident #6: a ruin
rail a fee heuristic can veto is not a ruin rail, and symmetrically a fee brake must never hold a
position that needs to die). Both thresholds REUSE documented desk constants (see below) rather
than minting new ones, and an unreadable measurement keeps the brake QUIET but is recorded
UNMEASURED in the decision's reasons (L1.41) -- never a phantom pause fabricated from missing
data (the 2026-07-26 fabricated-zero class), never a silent skip.

#: decisions on a box where the artifact is absent, stale or corrupt.
INCOME_ARTIFACT = _ROOT / "web/cashcarry_live.json"
#: Rolling window of (timestamp, cumulative funding, cumulative commission) samples taken from

#: short history to difference them. Machine-local state (data/ is gitignored), self-pruning.
BURN_WINDOW_FILE = _ROOT / "data/fee_burn_window.json"

#: Window length: §40's own measurement window -- `check_fee_carry_ratio` (scripts/max_audit.py)
#: reads `income_summary(now - 7 * 86400)`. Same window, so the brake and the alarm that begged
#: for authority are statements about the SAME quantity.
FEE_WINDOW_H = 7 * 24.0
#: §40's flat-book guard, verbatim (`if funding < 5.0: return`): with almost no harvest the fee
#: ratio explodes for reasons unrelated to execution quality, and false pauses train the desk to
#: ignore the brake. Applies to the RATIO trigger only -- the burn floor needs no denominator and
#: is exactly what catches a fee fire on a near-flat book.
FEE_MIN_FUNDING = 5.0
#: Fraction of the windowed harvest that windowed fees may consume before opens pause. REUSED,
#: not invented: this is `alert_frac=0.5` from `carry_bleed_report`
#: (libs/execution/carry_accounting.py) -- the desk's standing dashboard bar for "the leak is
#: eating the harvest" -- pinned equal by test. It sits strictly INSIDE §40's absolute
#: `ratio > 1.0` bar ("fees EXCEED the funding earned... cannot be net-positive while this

#: already has, so a burn that marks hide (a rally masking a fee fire) pauses at the same -15%
#: the DD breaker would have charged for it, and the brake leaves the identical
