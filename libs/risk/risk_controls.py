"""Growth-POSITIVE risk controls -- limits sized at the ruin boundary, never from fear.

Design axiom: geometric growth is g ~= mu - sigma^2/2, so cutting the LEFT TAIL cuts sigma^2 faster
than mu -> it RAISES compounding. Every control here is derived from the ruin / max-DD math
(growth_leverage + the dynamic-leverage ruin cap), NOT from arbitrary caution. A limit that
binds tighter than the ruin boundary would be false conservatism (a bug that lowers log-wealth); a
limit AT the boundary only ever fires when NOT firing would risk ruin -- which destroys all future
compounding. So in normal operation these controls do nothing, and in a tail event they preserve the
ability to keep compounding.

Four controls, in increasing severity:
  * exposure guard  -- gross notional may not exceed the ruin-boundary leverage x equity (a backstop
                       against a sizing bug; never binds while we deploy below the ruin cap).
  * VENUE CAP       -- no single exchange may hold more than `venue_cap` of equity (gap #54).
  * DD circuit break -- above a stress drawdown, PAUSE new opens (keep existing carries earning
                       funding; never realises a loss). Kelly-consistent: uncertainty up -> less.
  * ruin kill-switch -- only a catastrophic equity loss (>= drawdown_ruin) forces a full flatten.
                       For a delta-neutral book this means an exchange/basis catastrophe -> survive.

GAP #54 -- COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATION, THE ONE FATAL RISK NOTHING CAPPED. Per-name was capped at
35% and per-factor was capped, while the fraction of net worth sitting inside a single exchange
was capped by nothing at all: `grep -rn 'per_venue|venue_cap|venue_exposure'` returned zero hits
across the whole repo. SYSTEM_REVIEW ranks this fatal in its own words -- *"an FTX-class failure
is fatal to deployed capital regardless of strategy correctness"*. Every other control here
assumes the exchange gives the money back.

It belongs in THIS file rather than the executor because it is the same kind of object as the
others: a pure ruin-boundary limit, not an execution detail. And it lands BEFORE live keys
deliberately -- with one venue the cap binds at 100% and changes nothing today, which is exactly
why installing it now is free and retrofitting it the day a second venue exists is not.

#: GAP #54. Max fraction of equity permitted inside a single exchange.
#:
#: 1.0 is not "no cap" -- it is the honest cap for a ONE-VENUE desk, and it is the number that
#: makes this control safe to install today: it binds at exactly the level the desk already runs
#: at, so nothing changes now and the enforcement path is proven before it ever has to bind. The
#: moment a second venue exists this must drop (0.50 splits ruin risk in half; 0.35 matches the
#: per-name cap the desk already accepts). Lowering it is a principal decision, not a default,
#: because it is a real allocation constraint rather than a safety knob to be tightened silently.
