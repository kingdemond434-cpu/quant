"""How much a sleeve can trade before its own footprint eats its edge.

Medallion capped its own capital because more money damaged the edge. That is the honest
statement of what capacity is: the size at which expected impact cost equals expected edge, and
beyond which every extra lot LOSES money on average even though the signal is right.

WHAT IS MEASURED. The desk's bars carry `tick_volume` per hour and its cost model carries the
spread. A square-root impact model -- the one every published study since Almgren-Chriss settles
on for the mid-frequency band -- says the price concession for trading a fraction q of the
interval's volume is

    impact = k * sigma * sqrt(q)

with sigma the interval's return volatility and k an order-one constant. Setting impact equal to
the sleeve's per-trade edge and solving for q gives the participation at which the edge is fully
consumed; multiplied by the typical volume in the sleeve's entry hour, that is the capacity in
contracts, and the allocator's per-sleeve bound is the SMALLER of that and its risk bound.

STATED CONSERVATIVELY AND BY NAME. `tick_volume` is the count of price updates, not traded
contracts; it is a proxy for activity and is labelled as one. k is set at the top of the
published range rather than the middle. A capacity number that is too small costs a little
growth; one that is too large costs the edge itself. Where volume is absent the answer is None
and the caller keeps its risk bound, never an invented ceiling.
