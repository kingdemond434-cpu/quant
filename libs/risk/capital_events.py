"""CAPITAL EVENTS -- the only legitimate way out of a ruin-floor stop, and it is not a threshold.

THE ABSORBING STATE, measured 2026-07-30. `risk_controls.evaluate` flattens on
`dd_start = equity/start_equity - 1 <= -35%`, where `start_equity` is
`cashcarry_state["start_futures_equity"]` -- set ONCE at inception (2026-07-02, $5,000) and never
re-based. At audit time the book sat at -37.2% and had flattened on 113 consecutive rebalances,
100% of them, zero clears. The loop is self-sustaining and provably closed:

    flatten -> executor sets target/cands empty -> no opens -> no funding accrues
            -> equity is constant -> dd_start is constant -> flatten

The downstream cost is the launch itself: with no new fills, `execution_tape.coverage()["days"]`
froze at 26.42 against Gate 0's 28-day bar. The desk is closer to that criterion than it will ever
be again, and could not get closer by performing well.

=================================================================================================
WHAT IS **NOT** THE FIX
=================================================================================================
Lowering `drawdown_ruin`, re-basing automatically, or letting the executor clear its own stop.
L1.23 and the L2.8a immutable core forbid all three, and they are the same move: the optimiser
noticing that the cheapest way to resume trading is to move the rail that stopped it. The rail is
CORRECT -- the book really is down 37.2% from the capital it was given.

=================================================================================================
WHAT IS MISSING, AND IT IS A REAL GAP
=================================================================================================
A ruin floor is a STOP, not a pause, and this one has NO DEFINED WAY BACK. That is incomplete in
exactly the way L1.16a names for the research graveyard: *every kill records its re-entry
condition at kill time*. A risk stop with no re-entry condition is not maximally safe, it is
unspecified -- and unspecified states get resolved under pressure, by hand, at the worst moment.

The re-entry condition for a ruin stop is a CAPITAL EVENT: new money arrives, or the principal
formally restarts the book with a new inception. Both are acts a human performs, both change what
"drawdown from start" legitimately means, and neither is something the desk may do for itself.

THE ONE RULE THAT KEEPS THIS HONEST: a re-base with no new capital is REFUSED. Re-basing
`start_equity` to today's equity clears the breach instantly while nothing about the desk's
position has improved -- the pure form of eating the safety margin. Passing `deposit_usd=0`
therefore requires an explicit principal override carrying a written reason, which lands in an
append-only ledger. The full drawdown history is never erased: every event records the previous
inception, so cumulative loss since the FIRST inception is always reconstructible.
