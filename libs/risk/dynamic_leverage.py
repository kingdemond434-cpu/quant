"""Dynamic leverage controller -- leverage as a continuously optimized control variable.

Composes the existing growth-optimal Kelly analysis (`growth_leverage`) and forward-validation
confidence (`edge_gate`) into ONE recomputed number per sleeve and jointly for the portfolio,
in the full risk vector the constitution requires: expected edge, forecast UNCERTAINTY (sample size
forward days), realized vol, downside/tail risk, liquidity, slippage, market impact, funding cost,
correlation to the book, regime, execution reliability, model confidence.

Two design commitments from the constitution:
  1. NO arbitrary fixed cap. The ceiling is ENDOGENOUS = min(diminishing-returns argmax of E[log],
     the largest leverage whose bootstrapped risk-of-ruin <= tolerance). Survival is priority #1, so
     the ruin constraint binds -- but it's derived from the return distribution, not a magic number.
  2. Increase only when the expected log-growth gain exceeds the ruin-risk increase; degrade
     immediately when uncertainty/vol/liquidity/execution/confidence worsen. On a day-0 unvalidated
     edge, confidence ~ 0 -> the optimizer resolves to the low operational floor and *earns*
     as forward validation shrinks the error bars. It never cranks leverage on unproven edge.

Pure functions; `returns` must already be net of all costs. Recompute after every meaningful update.
