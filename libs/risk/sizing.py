"""Position-size synthesis — combine every governor; the tightest constraint binds.

size = (Equity x S_global x risk_budget x kelly x vol_scalar) / risk_per_unit, then clamped by
position / factor / heat caps (the minimum wins). The trade is rejected outright if expected net
edge <= cost (the cost-hurdle rule) or if no risk is left to allocate.

    ``edge_capacity_usd`` is the §42 governor: the dollars the EDGE ITSELF absorbs before its own
    impact eats it. Every other clamp here asks "how much risk may the book take?"; this one asks
    "how much can this edge hold?", and the two are independent -- a book with plenty of risk
    budget can still be far too large for a thin dislocation. Sizing past it does not lose money
    slowly, it DESTROYS THE EDGE, because at that point the desk's own flow is the counterparty it
    came to trade against. It joins the same tightest-constraint-binds set as every other cap, so
    an over-capacity sleeve is clamped rather than rejected: a $5k edge on a big book is still a
    good $1,250 trade, and refusing it outright would cost exactly the alphas §42 exists to keep.
