"""Dynamic risk scaling — the global dial that only ever cuts.

Combines every de-risking governor into one scalar via ``min`` (the tightest constraint
governs, avoiding over-compounding the cuts). De-risking is immediate; re-risking back toward 1
is gradual and is handled by the callers that own each governor.
