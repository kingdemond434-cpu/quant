"""Single source of truth for the CONCURRENT forward-confirmation slot cohort (the Holm `m`).

Under the TWO-STAGE DISCOVERY LAW the backtest gauntlet has ZERO promotion authority; promotion to
capital comes only from pre-registered FORWARD evidence, and the only multiplicity that applies
there is the number of CONCURRENTLY ACCRUING clocks -- Holm-corrected, capped at
MAX_FORWARD_SLOTS=12. That cohort size is therefore the single most load-bearing integer on the
desk's only path from research to capital.

It was being counted three different ways by three different files:
  * scripts/run_axis_shadows.py -- holm_bar(len(_AXES)) => m=4, the AXIS clocks only
  * scripts/run_alerts.py       -- len(registry) + a hardcoded `_standing = 6` + the axis count
  * data/shadow_sleeves.json    -- [], and it is a RUN-ROSTER of derivative sleeve names
                                   (scripts/run_derivative_shadow.py:77-81), never a cohort registry
Measured 2026-07-30: the axis clocks applied holm_bar(4)=2.24 while the true cohort was 12-13
(bar 2.64-2.67) -- alpha 0.0125 per clock against an intended 0.05/13=0.0038, a realized
family-wise error rate ~3.2x the design. Understating m LOOSENS the bar, so the error ran in the
PHANTOM-EDGE direction. Three deep sweeps (2026-07-26/28/29) each found this and each carried it.

FAIL-SAFE DIRECTION (deliberate, and the reason this is not a plain `len()`): a missing or
unreadable source silently SHRINKS m and loosens every bar, so unknown sources never count as
zero -- they mark the cohort `complete=False`, which run_alerts surfaces. Likewise a dormant clock
is counted until it is RETIRED by an explicit ledgered decision: over-counting only tightens the
bar (the safe error), under-counting admits noise as edge.
