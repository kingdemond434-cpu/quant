"""Auto-promotion / auto-retirement for shadow-validated sleeves.

Runs daily at 22:00 UTC inside the gateway loop (after shadow_forward.main()).

PROMOTE (fully automatic):
  - shadow verdict == PROMOTION CANDIDATE and not yet promoted:
    * XAUUSD challengers: promote only if their forward exp >= the armed gold
      sleeve's forward exp (live ledger, same window) - 0.02 margin; else KILL.
    * JPY-cross sleeves: promote directly at PROMOTED_LOT.
  - promoted sleeves are written to data/sleeves.json (status LIVE) and the
    gateway picks them up on the next pass (< 1 min).

RETIRE (fully automatic):
  - for each LIVE promoted sleeve: forward stats from the live ledger:
    * n >= 10 and rolling-20 exp <= 0      -> RETIRED (edge gone)
    * forward maxDD < -25R                 -> RETIRED (tail breach)
    * n >= 50 and exp < 0.05R              -> RETIRED (weak)
  - retired sleeves are removed from trading config and marked KILL in shadow
    state (never re-promoted).

The armed gold book is NOT managed here (hunt5 authority, armed by human).
