"""TURN A REACHABLE DATA AXIS INTO A SERIES A FAMILY CAN ACTUALLY CONDITION ON.

`data_axis_miner` answers "can this box reach the source". This answers the only question after
it: "is there a dated series on disk, in the shape the family's signature asks for". A source that
is reachable and unparsed unblocks nothing -- the breadth board would still read BLOCKED, and
correctly, because `family_cot_positioning(df, cot=None)` returns no signals.

THE SHAPES ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE -- they are read off the family signatures:

    family_cot_positioning(df, *, cot: pd.DataFrame | None)   net positioning, dated, per market
    family_macro_conditional(df, *, macro: pd.Series | None)  one state variable, dated

So the ingester's job is a DataFrame and a Series, both indexed by the date the desk could have
known the value -- not the date the value describes. Those differ for every economic release and
conflating them is the lookahead this desk has already paid for once, in the regime labels.

THE CFTC RELEASE LAG IS REAL AND IS APPLIED. A COT report is stamped with Tuesday's positions and
published the following Friday at 15:30 ET. Indexing it on Tuesday would hand every backtest three
days of knowledge nobody had. `KNOWABLE_LAG_DAYS` shifts the index to the publication date, and
the shift is deliberately generous rather than exact: being a day late costs a little edge, being
a day early invents it.

SIGN CONVENTIONS ARE THE SECOND TRAP. CME currency futures are quoted as FOREIGN/USD -- a long
JPY futures position is a SHORT USDJPY position. A net-positioning series wired in with the wrong
sign is not a weak signal, it is a confidently inverted one, and it would pass every gate that
tests for significance rather than direction. `INVERT` names every market where the desk's symbol
runs the other way.
