"""PROVIDER REVERSE-ENGINEERING -- ported from the Aurum desk, 2026-09-12.

PROVENANCE. This is `golddesk/reverse.py` from the sibling Aurum repository, carried over
essentially intact. It is stdlib-only (math, statistics, collections, dataclasses, datetime) and
fetches nothing -- it takes rows and analyses them -- so the port is a copy rather than a
translation, and the boundary it draws stays exactly where Aurum drew it: whoever COLLECTS the
rows answers for what is lawful to collect, and no import answers that question implicitly.

WHY THIS DESK WANTS IT. The desk already mines copy-trade providers at scale -- 205 files under
data/intelligence/mql5_signals and 205 more under darwinex, plus collective2, fxblue, duplitrade,
octa_masters and a dozen regional copy platforms. Every one of those is a published equity curve
attached to an unknown mechanism, and until now the desk could only read the CURVE. This reads the
MECHANISM: it groups fills into baskets, infers the structure that generated them, and runs ruin
forensics and ablations over that structure.

THE FINDING IT USUALLY PRODUCES is the one worth having. A long-lived, high-return copy provider
is most often a martingale or a grid with no hard stop -- the equity curve is smooth precisely
because the losses are deferred rather than avoided -- and `ruin_forensics` is what turns that
suspicion into a number. That is the same shape as the 91%-win-rate EA with a Sharpe of 43.65 the
principal asked about on 2026-09-12: not a good result, an impossible one, and this module is how
a desk says so with evidence instead of instinct.

IT PROPOSES, IT NEVER PROMOTES. Nothing here writes a sleeve, a certificate or a clock. Its output
is analysis a hypothesis can be built FROM, and anything built that way faces the identical ten
gates as every other candidate.

AURUM'S ORIGINAL HEADER, kept verbatim because the reasoning is the valuable part:

    Reverse-engineering a copy-trade provider: where does the return come from?

    The daily directive names a target — a long-lived, high-return MT5 copy system —
    and asks the only question worth asking about one: can we isolate the mechanism
    producing the return, strip the tail risk, and rebuild it independently with
    equal or better forward geometric growth?

    Everything here is built from data we are entitled to: the provider's own
    published statistics, and our OWN mirrored fills from a subscription we pay for.
    Nothing in this module fetches anything; it takes rows and analyses them, so the
    question of what is lawful to collect stays where it belongs — with whoever
    collects it — and never gets answered implicitly by an import.

    THE FINDING THIS MODULE EXISTS TO PRODUCE, AND WHY IT IS USUALLY THE SAME ONE

    A very large fraction of high-return, long-lived retail copy systems are not
    selling directional skill. They are selling INSURANCE: a grid or martingale that
    adds to losers until the market retraces, which converts a low-variance stream
    of small wins into a rare, total loss. The equity curve is beautiful precisely
    because the risk has been moved into a tail that has not arrived yet, and the
    longer the record, the more convincing the curve and the closer the ruin.

    That is why `ruin_forensics()` matters more than any return statistic here. A
    track record cannot show you the drawdown that ends the account, because if it
    had, the account would be gone and the provider delisted. Survivorship is not a
    caveat on this analysis — it is the mechanism generating the thing being
    analysed.

    So the decisive number is `recovery_free_return`: what the record would have
    paid with the recovery layer removed — first entry only, fixed size. If that is
    negative, the provider has no entry edge at all and the entire return is the
    short-volatility position. Copying it means inheriting a bet whose expected
    value depends on a retracement that is not promised.

    WHAT "IMPROVE, DO NOT CLONE" MEANS OPERATIONALLY

    If the third entry after two failures has the real expectancy, the honest
    strategy is to trade that third state DIRECTLY, on its own entry criteria,
    without first taking the two losing positions that produced it. `ablate()`
    produces exactly those variants so the question is settled by measurement.

    NOTHING HERE PROMOTES ANYTHING

    A reconstructed strategy is a hypothesis, and it enters `linkage.py` as a run
    against a registered claim like every other trial. That a provider made money is
    not evidence that a mechanism works; it is the reason to go looking.

    THE DISCRIMINATOR THAT WORKS WHEN ADDS-WHILE-LOSING DOES NOT. A provider who

    the two hypotheses directly and independently of P&L direction:

        A GRID HAS A LADDER. Adds land at a fixed interval by construction, so
        the coefficient of variation of the gaps is near zero however the market

        A STRUCTURE-DRIVEN SYSTEM adds at levels the market supplies -- an FVG,
        a sweep, a prior high -- and those arrive at irregular distances. The
        gaps scatter and the CV is large.

    A martingale can pyramid when price whipsaws back through its ladder, so
    direction alone cannot tell them apart. Only the spacing can.

    The distinction is not academic: a grid's basket depth is bounded by its own
    spacing, so its worst case is computable. A structure-driven basket's depth
    is bounded by how far the market runs before it stops offering levels, which
