"""Deep tick history for the MT5 universe, free, back roughly two decades.

PORTED FROM THE AURUM DESK (golddesk sibling repo) 2026-09-12, and adapted from three hard-coded
symbols to the whole registry. It arrives to close a NAMED gap: `liquidity_regime` sits on the
desk's breadth board as REACHABLE and blocked on "a spread series from the tick tape", and MT5
tick history is whatever the broker chose to keep -- months, not years. This is bid AND ask at
tick resolution, so the spread series is a subtraction rather than an estimate.

WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not broker-matched. `export_mt5.py` remains the right source for cost
calibration and for anything that must match the venue actually executed on; this is DEPTH, for
measuring a regime over years rather than weeks. Mixing the two silently would be the cost bug
this desk already paid for once.

WHY THIS AND NOT ONLY MT5

`export_mt5.py` gives BROKER-MATCHED data, which is the right thing for cost
calibration and for anything that has to match the venue you execute on. What it
usually will not give you is depth: MT5 tick history is whatever the broker
chose to keep, and for most retail brokers that is months rather than years.

Dukascopy publish tick-level bid/ask for XAUUSD going back to roughly 2003, free
and without an account. That is the difference between measuring management on a
few hundred trades and measuring it on tens of thousands, and management is
where this system's measured losses currently are — 15 of 20 trades reached +1R
and 2 survived, with zero intrabar observations on any of them.

USE BOTH, FOR DIFFERENT THINGS

  Dukascopy  -> depth. Structure, excursion, intrabar ordering, management
                research, scalp viability. Millions of ticks.
  Your MT5   -> truth about YOUR venue. Spread distribution, stops level,
                execution costs. Hundreds of thousands of ticks is plenty.

And then MEASURE the disagreement between them rather than assuming it is small.
`--compare` does exactly that against an MT5 export, which converts "third-party
data is close enough" from a hope into a number.

FORMAT NOTES, BECAUSE THEY BITE

  * The month in the URL is ZERO-INDEXED. January is 00. This is the single
    most common way to silently fetch the wrong month.
  * Each hour is an LZMA-compressed .bi5 of 20-byte records:
        uint32  milliseconds since the hour
        uint32  ask, scaled by the instrument's point factor
        uint32  bid, scaled the same way
        float32 ask volume
        float32 bid volume
    all BIG-endian.
  * Missing hours are normal — weekends, holidays, and genuine gaps all return
    404 or an empty body. An empty hour is recorded as empty rather than
    skipped, so coverage is measurable instead of assumed.

# THE POINT FACTOR IS THE VENDOR'S, NOT THE BROKER'S -- and conflating them is a silent 10x.
#
# Dukascopy ships integer prices scaled by ITS OWN quoting convention. The first port of this file
# derived the scale from `universe.json`'s `tick_size`, which is FUSION's convention, and the
# offline self-test failed immediately: gold decoded at 33000.500 where 3300.050 was expected,
# because Dukascopy quotes XAUUSD to three decimals and the broker quotes it to two. Every price
# would have been out by a factor of ten, and -- as the original author warned in this very file --
# "the error looks like a market crash rather than a bug".
#
# So the table is the VENDOR's, by asset class, and it is deliberately small. An unknown symbol is
# REFUSED rather than given a default: a default that is right for metals is wrong by 100x for FX,
# and this feed exists to build the spread series the liquidity-regime family will be judged on.
# Absence is not a permission (L1.28a).
#
# THE REGISTRY IS STILL USED -- as a CHECK. `check_scale()` re-prices a decoded tick against the
# broker's own last known level and refuses a symbol whose two sources disagree by more than an
# order of magnitude, which is the error this comment exists to describe.
