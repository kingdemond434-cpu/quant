# Prospector coverage map

_Seeded 2026-07-18; every family unvisited -- the first run biases per the rotation rule (>=40% of query budget to least-recently-covered). Log per session: family, date, queries spent, notable sources._

| Family | Last visited | Sessions | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Podcasts/interviews | 2026-07-19 | 1 | 1 ep (Pavel Kycek, algoadvantage.substack.com) — CLAIM-grade, generic momentum+meanrev, no mechanism; 0 cards |
| YouTube/talks | never | 0 | untouched this session — priority next run |
| Forums (deep+legacy) | 2026-07-25 | 1 | EN frontier miner: Bitcointalk ERA-ARCHAEOLOGY opened — boards 8 (Trading Discussion, 18,640 topics, 2011-14 era = offsets 14480-18640) + 78 (Securities, 2,376 topics) mapped via OP-021; topics 261086/95760/171349/330209/339040/14466 mined to reply-depth → 3 graveyard entries + EN era lexicon. Wilmott/EliteTrader/Nuclear Phynance still never touched |
| Social (X/Discord/Substack) | 2026-07-19 | 1 | 3 Substacks fetched (Maverick Quant, quantjourney [paywalled], algoadvantage) — 0 cards, mostly explainer/content-marketing grade |
| Code (GitHub/Kaggle) | 2026-07-19 | 1 | operator-named dig: ai_quant_trade, Qbot, QuantDinger, Vibe-Trading (READMEs+issues) + Hummingbot/Freqtrade issues — all infra/framework shells or equity factor zoos, 0 crypto-perp strategy logic; 0 cards but confirmed funding-arb is now commoditized into hummingbot's v2_funding_rate_arb.py (crowding evidence) |
| Academic (SSRN/arXiv) | never | 0 | untouched this session (RSRS is sell-side research, not SSRN/arXiv) — priority next run |
| Records (contests/CTA) | 2026-07-25 | 1 | partial, via forum route: Bitcointalk "Automated Trading Contest" (topic 261086, CryptoTrader.org rounds #1-#5) mined as a contest RECORD — produced the in-sample-vs-forward natural experiment graveyard entry. Kaggle G-Research + Numerai post-mortems still untouched |
| Non-English forums | 2026-07-26 | 2 | s1 (07-19): Chinese RSRS + funding-arb (CSDN/VeighNa/BigQuant/Zhihu/FMZ) + JP note.com — RSRS EV-killed, ML-funding-rate graveyard-matched. **s2 (07-26, CN frontier miner): axis #76 usdt-cny-otc-premium UN-PARKED — "no clean free API" REFUTED, 3 keyless routes, 591d history reconstructed (OP-031 CDX-replay of a capped JSON API), Stage-A screened 4/4 cells → no promotable edge but the catalogued mechanism's SIGN and MAGNITUDE priors both falsified. New: OP-031, OP-032, CN lexicon.** Era-archaeology (banzhuan/8btc/ChainNode/Tieba) still UNSTARTED — first item next run |
| AI/HF documentation | 2026-07-19 | 1 | touched only incidentally via Vibe-Trading (AI trading-agent platform) + ai_quant_trade (LLM module) — both infra, not alpha-discovery-process documentation; weak coverage, revisit properly next run |

## COVERAGE REALITY vs DIRECTIVE (honesty record, 2026-07-20)
Charter s25 "no source class skipped" and the specs' "dig to exhaustion" are STANDING
DIRECTIVES (how every dig must be run) -- they are NOT claims that the universe has been
covered. Actual state on 2026-07-20:
* Prospector: 1 session ever (2026-07-19), 0 cards. 4 of 9 families still NEVER visited
  (YouTube/talks, deep+legacy forums, academic SSRN/arXiv, contest/CTA records).
* 7 regional frontier miners: ACTIVATED 2026-07-20, ZERO runs so far (first crons fire
  00:15Z 07-21). Non-English coverage to date = ONE session touching surface-layer CN
  (CSDN/VeighNa/BigQuant/Zhihu/FMZ) + one JP note.com blog. The richmanbtc/note.com botter
  lineage (addendum C62, the named gem) is NOT yet dug.
* VIDEO: direct transcript fetch is IP-BLOCKED from this VPS (RequestBlocked, tested
  07-18). Video-origin material is currently reached ONLY via text mirrors (show notes,
  transcript blogs, Substack writeups, community summaries). GAP #26 is the unlock and is
  principal-spend-gated; it pages ONLY once the coverage log proves video-locked mechanisms
  are a recurring binding blocker -- not yet demonstrated, because YouTube/talks has never
  been worked at all.
* "DARK FOREST": the genuinely closed layer (private WeChat/QQ groups, paid Knowledge-Planet
  circles, invite-only Discords/Telegrams) is PERMANENTLY OUT OF SCOPE under charter s13 --
  closed-group and paid-content material is never scraped or adopted. What is in scope is the
  PUBLIC Chinese/regional layer, and that layer is barely scratched (one session).
Any future statement that a region or source class is "exhausted" must cite session counts
from this table. Directive != achievement.

## SESSION NOTES — EN frontier miner

### 2026-07-25 session A (RECONSTRUCTED post-hoc — the run died before writing this note; deliverables verified present in the repo by session B)
GROUNDS: Bitcointalk era-archaeology (dark-forest mandate #1) + HN items API + backlog burn-down.
DELIVERABLES (all confirmed on disk): 4 backlog re-verifications with primary artifacts
(Upbit portal: 4 of 5 old claims REFUTED, real API extracted from webpack chunk, 1m candles reach
2017-10-24 not 2023-07 — a 5.7yr understatement from one mistranslated Korean character (초봉=1s
bars, not 분봉); bitFlyer: 31-day wall confirmed 3 ways incl. exact binary-searched boundary id
2646808096; Tardis: backfill-destroyed claim REFUTED, full-depth L2 free every 1st-of-month
2019-04→2026-07 ≈ 88 ground-truth days; Kaiko: index methodology public (BMR rulebook PDF, VWM+TWAP),
$1-2.5k/mo pricing claim struck as unsourced). 3 graveyard entries (era_ta_indicator_stack_crypto —
the round #2/#3-forward-vs-round-#5-in-sample natural experiment; era_grid_ladder_vol_bot — GMVT-BOT
short-gamma economics; era_crossvenue_fiat_premium_arb — 3 instances, premium=barrier-rent).
4 inbox items (#54 grade-provenance rail, #55 fill-rate decay discriminator from HN 9642325 depth-2
reply, #56 premium-as-barrier-rent prior, #57 side/depth phantom-arb rail from topic 14466 reply #19).
3 operators (OP-020 SMF printpage, OP-021 board-tail era-seek, OP-022 HN items tree-walk) + the
corpus-derived EN era lexicon (5,702-topic frequency differencing — finding: era vocabulary is
VENUES+RAILS, not strategies).
DEPTH LINE: topic 261086 read to post #285 of 301 (printpage, full thread); 171349 replies #37/#39
mined (fee-stack + OKPAY-reserve refutations); 339040 replies #7/#13 (capital-control mechanics);
14466 reply #19 (side/depth debunk); HN 9638748 walked to depth≥2 (53 of 65 comments), 9642325
depth-2. Era-seek calibrated by 8-offset binary probe. NOT breadth-theater: every carded find came
from a reply layer, none from an OP.
UNFINISHED AT DEATH (completed by session B): this coverage note; universe-map sync of the 4
re-grades; Glassnode/CryptoQuant handoff (inbox #54 names it next).
DIASPORA (standing question): where did Bitcointalk's 2011-14 strategy posters go? Partial answer
in-thread: CryptoTrader.org (the contest platform) → closed 2018; visible migration to
private/paid Telegram signal groups (OUT OF SCOPE s13) and QuantConnect/Quantopian — the public
successor ground IS the Quantopian archive (already on the region list, still undug).

### 2026-07-25 session B (this run — backlog burn-down per RESUME mandate; verification WAS the session)
COMPLETED SESSION A's UNFINISHED ITEMS: this coverage note pair; universe-map sync of the 4
session-A re-grades (Upbit/bitFlyer/Tardis/Kaiko); the inbox-#54 Glassnode/CryptoQuant handoff.
BACKLOG: 7 pending-verification + 2 legitimacy at open → **2 pending (both externally blocked) +
3 legitimacy at close; 8 of 13 resolved.** Verdicts, each from primary artifacts actually opened:
- §7 Glassnode/CryptoQuant: claimed Dune path key-gated (401/403 keyless — demoted secondary);
  BETTER primary found+verified: **Coin Metrics community** (btc.csv 2.48MB/6,352 rows 2009→
  2026-05; flows since 2011-04; LIVE keyless community API current T+1; GitHub mirror STALE
  since 2026-05-24). CC BY-NC → legitimacy queue. CM netflow = 15yr backfill + independent diff
  target for desk onchain_flows.
- §4 Bithumb: **"paid-mirror-only" gap REFUTED** — v1 Upbit-schema keyless API paginates daily
  to 2014-01-13 (epoch≈launch) and **1m to at least 2014-05-31** — 4.7yr deeper than the paid
  mirror, 3.5yr deeper than Upbit's portal; deepest free KRW minute archive known to the desk.
  Two-API same-venue diff exact on overlap. Futures docs lead DEAD (404). Licence/ToS still open.
- §9 stablecoin mint/burn: **mechanism verified integer-exact** (24h USDC: 2,404 mints 375.8M −
  1,656 burns 564.6M = totalSupply Δ −188.76M after boundary-block fix; convention (then,now]
  documented). Treasury-first failure mode confirmed live (Circle wallet took 300.7M of mints).
- §11 eth-labels: **downgraded to supplementary-only** — all 3 canonical Binance wallets absent,
  label/nameTag contradictions at scale (bilaxy label on "Binance Dep" tags); cross-diffed vs
  cex-list (276/373 overlap). §12 cex-list verified as era-correct 2023 snapshot (last commit
  2023-07-27), the cleaner-but-tiny counterpart.
- §21 NAVER: endpoint live-confirmed (error body 024 keyless); sole blocker = free key (human).
- §3 bitFlyer licence: Wayback route exhausted (0 snapshots) — 2 failed routes logged; needs
  non-blocked egress. TIME-SENSITIVE: 31-day window keeps destroying history daily.
SCREEN-ON-DISCOVERY (s26, same-run): new axis CapMVRVCur (CM) Stage-A screened → TIMING-ARTIFACT
(same-period corr 0.416 — price-numerator ratio at 20d-z is momentum in disguise); graveyarded
with pre-registered weekly/orthogonalized escalation. 1 construction, 1 verdict, logged.
ECOLOGY SHIFTS (s21, logged in inbox #58): registry eth_public_rpc chain 3/4 dead for getLogs
(ankr key-walled, publicnode token-gating); working keyless set = MEV-relay RPCs (flashbots/
mevblocker ≥700-blk); CryptoCompare min-api key-walled (killed the independent Bithumb diff);
CM GitHub mirror stale. Free-tier ENCLOSURE is a trend; same-day replacements found each time.
CONTRIBUTED: OP-023 (per-method RPC capability matrix), OP-024 (conservation-law reconciliation);
inbox #58. Registry defects flagged-not-edited (freeze): eth_public_rpc chain, Tardis $599 tier.
DEPTH LINE: verification session — depth = artifacts opened/downloaded per card (CSV downloads,
live API probes incl. 18-chunk getLogs reconciliation, boundary-block root-cause, cross-diffs);
zero new forum grounds opened (deliberate: RESUME mandate makes verification the priority, and
session A banked today's era-archaeology dig. NOT breadth-theater — nothing was surface-scanned.)
COUNTERFACTUALS (s17): Bithumb 2014-depth find LOW-MED (public API but the depth documented
nowhere; found only by boundary-probing — the paid mirror was universally believed deeper).
CM-covers-the-flow-class MED (CM community is known, but no desk card connected it to the
Glassnode/CryptoQuant replacement question or knew it was keyless-current).
DIASPORA (carried): Quantopian archive = the public successor ground of the Bitcointalk-era
posters — next dig target, with never-touched Wilmott/EliteTrader/Nuclear Phynance.
NEXT-SESSION QUEUE: (1) Kaiko VWM+TWAP diff vs desk normalizer (fully unblocked); (2) OP-008
binance trades 2026-07-01 Tardis-vs-recorder diff (unblocked); (3) desk-netflow vs CM-netflow
overlap diff; (4) Quantopian archive dig; (5) re-probe apidocs.bithumb.com for ToS.

### 2026-07-26 — VIDEO IS NOT BLOCKED (refutes the 07-18 finding, retires the GAP #26 purchase gate)
The standing record said "VIDEO: direct transcript fetch is IP-BLOCKED from this VPS
(RequestBlocked, tested 07-18)", and GAP #26 gated a PAID residential-proxy purchase on it. Half
right, wholly misleading: the DIRECT `youtube.com/api/timedtext` route does return empty from this
box, but PIPED instances (open-source YouTube proxies) serve the same caption tracks freely.
VERIFIED: `api.piped.private.coffee` returned 6 subtitle tracks and 2,089–2,165 chars of real
transcript text, keyless, first try. Bilibili is reachable through its own public API
(view → cid → subtitle json); videos without public CC honestly report none.
TOOL: `scripts/fetch_video_transcript.py <url|id>` (rotates 4 Piped instances) and
`--bilibili <BVid>`. VIDEO-LOCKED LOGGING IS NO LONGER A PURCHASE TRIGGER for YouTube — log only
genuinely unreachable platforms. LESSON: one failed route was generalised to "video is blocked" and
then gated a purchase; a negative result is about the ROUTE TESTED, never the whole capability.

### 2026-07-26 session C (EN frontier miner) — IN PROGRESS (write-first note; updated as items resolve)
ITEMS THIS RUN (bounded per completion contract):
1. BACKLOG BURN: (a) NAVER DataLab — re-confirm endpoint live + still key-blocked-on-human;
   (b) Kaiko — resolve the T1-a "RE-RUN REQUIRED" blocker facts: does Kaiko publish its Reference
   Rate FIXINGS freely (no fixings ⇒ no tracking diff is possible with ANY constituent set), and
   does crypto.com's public REST serve a deep trades tape (adapter feasibility)? Verdict → card.
2. QUANTOPIAN ARCHIVE DIG (era-archaeology, dark-forest mandate #1; the carried diaspora target):
   find the durable public archive route, map the ground, mine ≥2 strategy threads to reply-depth.
3. IF BUDGET REMAINS: apidocs.bithumb.com ToS re-probe (queue item 5).
STATUS: item 1 CLOSED (results below, write-up in watchlist/universe map in progress); item 2 next.
ITEM 1 RESULTS (all from live probes this run):
- NAVER: endpoint live (error 024 keyless, re-confirmed) — still blocked ONLY on the human free-key
  step. No change; stays pending-external.
- crypto.com public/get-trades: keyless, `end_ts` backward pagination, count cap 150/call, archive
  floor measured between 1370d and 1420d ago (serves 2022-10-25, empty by ~2022-09) ≈ **3.8 years
  of free tick history on a TRUE Kaiko constituent** — adapter feasible; deeper than bitstamp's 24h
  by ~1400×. Boundary probed at 12h/7d/30/90/365/730/1095/1250/1300/1370/1420d.
- KAIKO FIXINGS ROUTE FOUND (the T1-a "RE-RUN REQUIRED" unblocked on the ground-truth side):
  CFE **PBT (Continuous Bitcoin futures, settles to the Cboe Kaiko Bitcoin Index)** daily settlement
  is FREE per-date CSV: `cboe.com/us/futures/market_statistics/settlement/csv/?dt=YYYY-MM-DD`
  (2026-07-24: PBT/Z35 = 64156.00). Launch between 2025-12-01 (absent) and 2026-01-02 (present).
  LICENCE DISTINCTION (s13): these are Cboe's OWN futures settlement statistics, not Kaiko's
  key-gated index feed — no Kaiko value is redisseminated. T1a line 589 ("Published rate + index
  VALUES: NO") upgrades to PARTIAL-daily via this route.
- BONUS (same directory): `cdn.cboe.com/api/global/us_indices/definitions/all_indices.json` = 2,286
  indices; free 15-min-delayed quotes at `/api/global/delayed_quotes/quotes/_SYM.json` (verified
  _CMUSDTUSD = 0.9992 live). Includes **18 Coin Metrics reference prices (CMUSDTUSD/CMUSDCUSD peg
  series, CMXMRUSD…), CoinRoutes RealPrice family, Lukka LKRX/LKRE** — three more BMR-class
  administrator families disseminated free through the exchange. NOT new signal axes (redundant
  SOURCES for prices the desk can already compute) — no Stage-A owed on those; the one genuine
  axis-candidate is the PBT basis/regulated-funding series, handled next.

## SESSION NOTES — CN frontier miner

### 2026-07-26 session 1 (CN frontier miner) — IN PROGRESS (write-first note; updated as items resolve)
PRIOR CN STATE (read before starting, per resume rule): exactly ONE prior CN session ever
(2026-07-19, surface-layer CSDN/VeighNa/BigQuant/Zhihu/FMZ) → RSRS found + EV-killed,
ML-funding-rate-prediction graveyard-matched. Ground is effectively unmined. Mine gate:
BACKLOG-CLEAR. Backlog verify-queue items (Kaiko, NAVER) were both closed by EN session C this
same day — not re-run here (that would be duplicated work, not resumption).

ITEMS THIS RUN (bounded per completion contract — depth maxed, breadth bounded):
1. **DEFECT-CLOSER, Tier-1 — universe-map axis #76 `usdt-cny-otc-premium` is CATALOGUED BUT NEVER
   INGESTED** (cataloged 2026-07-22, grade UNVERIFIED, parked on the claim *"no clean free API
   found; TradingView script is a lead, not a feed"*). This is the exact leak SCREEN-ON-DISCOVERY
   was written to close, sitting in MY region. Attack the routing claim: hunt a free live
   USDT/CNY (and USDT/RMB OTC) quote route. If one exists → catalog it, pull history, and run
   `libs.research.axis_screen` Stage-A **in this run**. Mechanism prior is the desk's strongest:
   kimchi premium scored IC +0.148 / timing Sharpe 1.3, and the desk's OWN graveyard entry
   `era_crossvenue_fiat_premium_arb` establishes *premium magnitude tracks BARRIER HEIGHT* —
   mainland China has the highest barrier in the world (capital controls + the 2021 total ban),
   so the CNY premium is the highest-barrier premium available and, per that same entry, must be
   used as an INFORMATION/TIMING signal and NEVER sized as arb.
2. **ERA-ARCHAEOLOGY (dark-forest #1) — the `banzhuan` (搬砖, cross-border arb) era on the CN
   boards** (8btc/Babbit, ChainNode old boards, Baidu Tieba bitcoin bar) via Wayback. Hunts the
   HISTORICAL provenance + mechanics of the same premium mechanism as item 1 (deliberately paired,
   not scattered): what drove the CNY premium, what killed each era of it, where the barrier sat.
   Plus dark-forest #2: extend the CN lexicon in the operator library with every new term learned.
3. IF BUDGET REMAINS: Gitee / CN-GitHub repo chain (vn.py lineage, factor libraries) per OP-001.
STATUS: **item 1 CLOSED to depth (results below). Item 2 NOT STARTED — honest, not padded; item 1
absorbed the run. Item 2 + 3 carry to CN session 2 as the FIRST items.**

#### ITEM 1 — CLOSED. Axis #76 un-parked, ingested, screened. [§33: screened -> data/cny_otc_premium_history.jsonl]
THE PARKED CLAIM WAS WRONG. #76 sat 4 days on *"no clean free API found; TradingView script is a
lead, not a feed."* Three keyless routes exist and all agree: OKX C2C (`/v3/c2c/tradingOrders/books`,
393 ads both sides with full depth), Binance P2P (`/bapi/c2c/v2/friendly/c2c/adv/search`), and
`history.btc126.com/usdt/api.php` for daily history. ECB (`api.frankfurter.app`) serves the FX leg
free back to 1999. HTX/Huobi OTC answers 200 but `totalCount=0` — CNY OTC has **left** Huobi
(diaspora datapoint). ChaiNext, the original index publisher, is **NXDOMAIN**: btc126 is a surviving
mirror of a dead index family, so it is a single point of failure and the desk's own recorder must
stay primary.
- **WHAT UNLOCKED IT: the native-language query, and nothing else** (now OP-032). Controlled A/B in
  the same minute: the English query returned CoinGecko/CMC boilerplate and the explicit conclusion
  *"may not be readily available through standard free APIs"* — a confident FALSE NEGATIVE. The
  Chinese query `USDT 场外价格 历史数据 API 人民币 溢价指数` returned the formal index definition plus
  the site serving the free history. This is the desk's LLM-translation edge paying out literally.
- **HISTORY RECONSTRUCTED (now OP-031).** The api.php route hard-caps at a rolling ~177 rows; ten
  parameter guesses all returned the identical 177. The cap is unliftable — but the *endpoint* is
  archived. CDX-replaying `api.php` itself (with the `id_` raw flag) recovered 414 more days.
  **591 daily rows, 2020-03-16 → 2026-07-25** → `data/cny_otc_premium_history.jsonl`. Gap
  2021-05-08→2026-01-26 is permanently unrecoverable (only 4 captures exist) and is declared, not
  hidden. `row_id=10` on 2020-03-16 proves the series begins ~2020-03-06, so the gap is *bounded*.
  Context for scale: the desk's live recorder `data/cny_premium.jsonl` held **4 rows** — the axis was
  unscreenable before this run.
- **MEASUREMENT CROSS-VALIDATED THREE WAYS** on the same date: desk-computed OKX mid ÷ ECB =
  **−0.623%**, btc126 published = **−0.62%**, desk recorder (Binance P2P) = **−0.618%**.
- **STAGE-A SCREEN RUN (audited harness, all 4 cells reported, no cherry-pick):** block1 h1d
  UNDERPOWERED (IC −0.027); block1 h5d UNDERPOWERED **+ de-contam FAILED** (same-period corr −0.281);
  block2 h1d **SCREEN-INTERESTING** (n=155, IC −0.0748, reversal Sharpe 1.39, de-contam passed) **but
  `powered=false`** — min-detectable IC 0.157 > |IC| 0.075, i.e. **not distinguishable from zero**;
  block2 h5d INSUFFICIENT-DATA (n=36). Alignment declared (23:55 CST = 15:55 UTC, predicts UTC-day
  D+1; **robust to the timezone ambiguity** — forward-only either way). Quantization checked:
  std/tick 9.5 and 4.0, above the 3.0 floor, so signal not rounding.
- **HONEST VERDICT: no promotable edge.** No clock, no Holm slot, no capital. But two findings
  survive the null, and BOTH contradict the catalogued prior:
  (1) **the sign is backwards** — all 4 cells negative (premium up → next-day return *down*), against
  #76's "premium up = inflow = bullish";
  (2) **the magnitude prior is falsified** — premium std collapsed **1.397% (2020-21) → 0.580%
  (2026)**, now **~4× smaller than kimchi** (2.0–2.3%). China holds the world's highest capital
  barrier and the world's *smallest* stablecoin premium. Reconciling variable: **merchant-network
  depth** (393 live ads on one venue). This refines the desk's own `era_crossvenue_fiat_premium_arb`
  rule — barrier height sets the premium's *ceiling*; merchant density sets where inside it it sits.
- **ADJACENCY MOVE (proactive battery #2), run in the same pass — NEGATIVE and informative.** Applied
  OP-031 to the desk's other capped endpoint of identical shape (`bitcoin-data.com/v1/mvrv` etc.,
  1,461-row window, params accepted-and-ignored): **0 CDX captures**, nothing recoverable. So
  OP-031's success rate is set by *archive density*, not by the cap — API paths are archived far more
  sparsely than HTML pages. Operator updated with a "check CDX count first" precondition.
- FLEET CONTRIBUTIONS (charter §16): **OP-031** (Wayback-replay a JSON API to defeat a rolling cap),
  **OP-032** (search the native language FIRST — with the A/B evidence), and the **CN lexicon** (12
  terms, those confirmed in live use this run marked ✓).

DEPTH LINE: axis #76 — **exhausted for this route**: live routes probed both sides (393 ads), history
route parameter-attacked 10 ways, CDX-replayed to its floor, series cross-validated against two
independent constructions, screened across 4 target-horizon cells, quantization and timezone
robustness both tested, and the adjacency instance tested and closed. Not surface, not breadth-theater.
NEXT RUN TAKES FIRST: (1) era-archaeology — `搬砖` banzhuan-era threads on 8btc/Babbit + ChainNode +
Tieba via Wayback (unstarted this run); (2) Gitee / CN-GitHub repo chain per OP-001.
OPEN QUESTION CARRIED (diaspora): CNY OTC has left Huobi — the live books are on OKX and Binance P2P.
Where did the *discussion* go? (OKX/Bitget/Gate CN communities, CN-language Telegram/X.)
